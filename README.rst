Static Assets
=============

django-staticassets is a django app to compile and bundle static assets, it
works together with django's contrib staticfiles app. Heavly inspired by ruby's
`Sprockets <https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets>`_. it has a the same directive processor to declare dependencies
directly in asset source files.
